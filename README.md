# Final-Project-CSCI-1082

// For our final project, 

// We will be creating a fight simulation game, allowing users to enter a series of moves and actions that they would like their character to do, and the program will display the information for what happened based on the inputs for the actions and characters from the users!

// Actions will include a series of moves for which the user can select to try and beat the opposing character, which will include blocking and attacking actions as well as a series of special moves. We are still working on finalizing our idea for the program and will add to the read.me based on what we decide!
